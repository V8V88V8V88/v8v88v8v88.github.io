<h1>Minimalism</h1>


<p class="lead">
    There's something inherently beautiful about simplicity. I didn't realize it back then, but minimalism has quietly shaped almost everything I've done in my life.
</p>

<p>
    I'm 22 now, a final-year Computer Science student, and if I look back, this love for "less is more" started long before I even knew what design principles or philosophies meant. When I first stumbled upon UNIX-like systems, I was fascinated, not because they were fancy, but because they were elegant in their simplicity. Every command had a purpose. Nothing felt unnecessary. That clicked with me instantly.
</p>

<p>
    When I began learning design, I didn't take any formal courses. It was just me, my laptop, and endless YouTube tutorials. I started with posters, experimenting, failing, improving, and eventually, some of those designs even turned into small paid gigs. But one thing always stayed the same: my approach. I believed designs should breathe. No clutter, no noise, just clean lines and intention.
</p>

<p>
    Even back in 2017, when I was active on Indian Amino, I was the one constantly pushing for simpler, balanced designs. Many people thought simplicity meant being plain or lazy, but for me, it was the highest form of creativity. It wasn't about removing things for the sake of it; it was about keeping what truly matters.
</p>

<p>
    Then came the programming arc, the next chapter of my story. My code followed the same philosophy. Every line needed a reason to exist. No unnecessary complexity, no overengineering, just clarity. I've always believed that beauty lies in things that are simple yet strong.
</p>

<p>
    Around the same time, I discovered GNOME, and it immediately felt like home. Its clean interface, balanced design, and focus on doing one thing well completely matched my mindset. GNOME wasn't trying to impress with too many options or distractions; it was calm, focused, and beautiful in its simplicity. That's why it became my favorite desktop environment on Linux, and also the first one I chose for my major development setup. It perfectly reflected how I wanted to build and interact with technology.
</p>

<p>
    Even during my time as president of The FOSS Club, that mindset guided everything I did. My tenure may have ended a few months ago, but that KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and minimalistic approach still defines how I work and think today. Whether it's writing code, designing something, or organizing a project, I follow the same rule: make it simple, make it meaningful.
</p>


<p>
    Simple and beautiful, that's how it's always been, and that's how I want it to stay.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
    A minimalistic person's approach isn't about doing less; it's about doing what truly matters, with care and intention. That's what I admire most about it.
